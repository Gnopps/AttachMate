## Obsidian Rewarder

### Intro

This is a plugin that helps you when you drop attachments that Obsidian can't display natively (e.g. email messages dragged from Outlook). It offers two features:

1. **Remove preview of attachment from note**. This is done by removing the exclamation mark before the attachment, so it will be `[[attachment.msg]]` instead of `![[attachment.msg]]`

2. **Prompt for an alternative text to be displayed** (can be turned off in settings). Instead of the attachment being displayed as `[[RE RE latest update]]`, you can easily type in your own text, e.g. `[[RE RE latest update|email about ACME status]]` that will display instead of the file name.
